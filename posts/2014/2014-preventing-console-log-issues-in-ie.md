In some older browsers, including versions of Internet Explorer, `window.console` doesn't exist and therefore calling `console.log()` will result in an error.

One way of fixing this is to create a function which checks whether `console` exists and use this function instead:

```js
function consolelog(v){
    if (window.console
        && window.console.log){
        window.console.log(v);
    }
}
```

However this requires all developers knowing about this function, and if someone forgets and directly calls `console.log()` then older browsers will still throw an error.

Therefore a better solution is to check whether `console.log()` exists, and if not, create an empty function which prevents the error occurring.

```js
if (!(window.console
    && window.console.log)){
    window.console = {
        log:function(v){return;}
    }
}
```

Alternatively a better shorthand method would be:

```js
window.console = window.console || {log:function(a){}};
```
