ASP.NET MVC Razor helpers are a great way of reducing duplicated code by containing code snippets in a View which can then be called multiple times.

```html
<div>
    @DisplayGreeting("Curtis")
</div>

@helper DisplayGreeting(string name)
{
    <span>Hello @name</span>
}
```

However what if you wish to call this same helper on another View?

In which case the helper can be stored in a seperate View in the "App_Code" folder.

For example create a new View in the "App_Code" folder called "MyHelpers.cshtml":

<img src="/post/2015-how-to-store-razor-helpers-globally/HelpersSolutionExplorer.jpg" alt="HelpersSolutionExplorer" width="209" height="112" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-229" />

Move the helper code into this file:

<img src="/post/2015-how-to-store-razor-helpers-globally/MyHelpersView.jpg" alt="MyHelpersView" width="319" height="108" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-230" />

Then the helper can be called from the previous view by using `MyHelpers.DisplayGreeting`:

```html
<div>
    @MyHelpers.DisplayGreeting("Curtis")
</div>
```

This way any View within the same ASP.NET MVC Application can then make use of this helper.
