[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) is a powerful Single-Page-Application javascript framework created by Google.

The following is a simple tutorial on how to set up an AngularJS application to display a javascript array of user information.

First of all we'll start by creating our javascript array. The following is an array of user information containing details of Name, Gender and Location.

```js
var userData = [
    {
        Name: "John Smith",
        Gender: "M",
        Location: "Wales"
    },
    {
        Name: "Sally Smith",
        Gender: "F",
        Location: "USA"
    },
    {
        Name: "Curtis Timson",
        Gender: "M",
        Location: "England"
    },
    {
        Name: "Sam Wallace",
        Gender: "M",
        Location: "England"
    },
    {
        Name: "Caroline James",
        Gender: "F",
        Location: "Scotland"
    }
];
```

Next we'll set up the HTML application container required:

```html
<div ng-app="myApp"></div>
```

We can then initialise this as an Angular application by calling `angular.module()`. This will become the scope of our application. Therefore our `myApp` will not be able to influence HTML outside of this container.

```js
var myApp = angular.module("myApp", []);
```

Now that the application has a variable, `myApp`, we can add a controller to it and create a new variable containing the user data:

```js
myApp.controller("myController", function($scope){
    $scope.users = userData;
});
```

Therefore `$scope.users` now references our original array of user data.

Going back to our HTML, we can now back a reference to the controller:

```html
<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myController"></div>
```

Within this `div` element we can now access the `users` variable. Therefore we can create an unordered list element, and by using `ng-repeat` create a loop of list items. AngularJS uses `{{ }}` to be able to access properties of the current object in the loop.

```html
<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myController">
    <ul>
        <li ng-repeat="user in users">{{user.Name}} | {{user.Location}}</li>
    </ul>
</div>
```

Here we are looping through all `user in users` to display multiple `li` elements and display the Name and Location of each user.

And that's it!

Below is a working example of the above tutorial I've put together on jsFiddle. Feel free to edit it and play around.
