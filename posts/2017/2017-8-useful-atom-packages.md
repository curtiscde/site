If you're unfamiliar with Atom, it's an open source IDE developed by [GitHub](http://github.com) which I currently use for front-end development.

When initially installed Atom isn't very rich in features, however it's heavily customisable through [packages](https://atom.io/packages). At the time of writing there are over *6000 packages* available to install.

## How to install atom packages

Atom packages can either be installed using a CLI or through Atom itself.

To install through Atom go to **Settings → Install** and search for the package which you wish to install.

Alternatively installing via a CLI is much quicker and requires only the following command:

```bash
apm install <package name>
```

## Recommended Packages

### File Icons

![File Icons](/post/2017/2017-8-useful-atom-packages/file-icons.png)

**Settings → Install → file-icons** | `apm install file-icons`

File Icons updates the tree-view and tab icons within Atom to show an icon which represents the file type. This is very handy when quickly trying to find a particular file.

----------------------


### Minimap

https://github.com/atom-minimap/minimap

![Minimap Example](/post/2017/2017-8-useful-atom-packages/minimap-example.png)

**Settings → Install → minimap** | `apm install minimap`

Minimap adds a small preview of the contents of the file alongside the scrollbar. This is helpful for quick navigation, and also gives a perspective of whereabouts in the file you're at.

----------------------

## Pigments

**Settings → Install → pigments** | `apm install pigments`

Atom Pigments visualises CSS colours such as Hex and RGB. But it also parses css-preprocessor variables as well as functions. One feature that the below animation doesn't represent which I find helpful is that it will also pick up the value of the preprocessor variables, even when they're declared in different files.

----------------------

## Highlight Selected

https://atom.io/packages/highlight-selected

![Highlight Selected](/post/2017/2017-8-useful-atom-packages/highlight-example.gif)

**Settings → Install → pigments** | `apm install pigments`

The Highlight Selected package is simple, but very useful. When you select a word in the document, all other instances of this word are highlighted.

----------------------

## Todo Show

https://atom.io/packages/todo-show

![Todo Show](/post/2017/2017-8-useful-atom-packages/todo-example.png)

**Settings → Install → todo show** | `apm install todo-show`

Todo Show will collate all the `TODO` comments throughout your code and display them in a quick table. Each record will also have a quick link through to the file and line of code containing the `TODO`.

----------------------

## Emmet

https://atom.io/packages/emmet

**Settings → Install → emmet**

The Emmet package is a plugin for the original [emmit toolkit](https://emmet.io/). Basically this allows you to write CSS selectors in HTML which by pressing tab will parse into a HTML structure.

Here's a simple example:

```html
html>head+body>div.container
```

Pressing tab this would then become:

```html
<html>
<head></head>
<body>
  <div class="container"></div>
</body>
</html>
```

However emmet also has the ability for more complex syntax, such as loops. For example:

```html
html>head+body>div.container>p.item$*2>a[href='item$']{Link $}
```

Becomes:

```html
<html>
<head></head>
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <p class="item1"><a href="item1">Link 1</a></p>
    <p class="item2"><a href="item2">Link 2</a></p>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

Great when you're trying to put a quick bit of HTML together.

----------------------

## EditorConfig

https://atom.io/packages/editorconfig

**Settings → Install → editorconfig** | `apm install editorconfig`

EditorConfig is a universal file format which helps developers define and maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs.

This package will override Atom's default text editor behaviour with the preset configuration in the `.editorconfig` file.

More information about the EditorConfig syntax can be found at [editorconfig.org](http://editorconfig.org/).

----------------------

## drag-relative-path

![Todo Show](/post/2017/2017-8-useful-atom-packages/drag-relative-path-example.gif)

**Settings → Install → drag-relative-path** | `apm install drag-relative-path`

Coming from a Visual Studio IDE in the past I'm used to being able to drag and drop JS/CSS files from the tree-view into a HTML file and have this automatically convert into a `script` or `link` references.

This package emulates this ability as well as allowing you to copy from desktop too.
