If you are to put an element into XSLT without any child elements, the element will automatically close itself. Therefore, if you have the following markup:

```html
<div class="clear"></div>
```

XSLT will automatically render this as:

```html
<div class="clear" />
```

This is fine for most elements, however some elements such as `<div>` will behave differently if they are self-closed.

A good way of preventing this from happening is to add an empty value into the `<div>` element like so:

```html
<div class="clear"><xsl:value-of select="''"/></div>
```

This will tell the XSLT rendering engine that there is some form of content inside the element, and therefore not to close itself. The rendered output would then be:

```html
<div class="clear"></div>
```
